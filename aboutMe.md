###About Me

My name is Abby Farnsworth. I currently work as a rate lock analyst at Guild Mortgage Company. I have been working in the mortgage industry for almost seven years. In 2018, I began to feel that it was time to pursue a new career, and I decided to enroll in Southern New Hampshire University with the goal of obtaining my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology. Once I began classes, I got interested in Cybersecurity and decided to concentrate my degree in that field.

I previously attended the New England College of Business and graduated in 2015 with my Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration, concentrated in Banking and Finance.

I am orginially from Massachusetts, but I moved to Maine in 2017 and never looked back. I now live in a tiny rural town in Central Maine and I love it. In my spare time, I enjoy working on my house, gardening, reading, and playing with my two cats.
